The data directory should be kept empty in the repository, but this is where all data (in its various forms) should be kept localy.

Here is directory structure proposal:

```
data/
├── cohorts/
├── processed/
└── interim/
```

Where:
1. `cohorts` holds the original cohorts generated by, for example, `yaib-cohorts`
2. `processed` would, for example, hold the data with already extracted features
3. `interim` would, for example, hold any intermediate data, such as maybe data with imputed values
