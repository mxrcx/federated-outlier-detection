The data directory should be kept empty in the repository, but this is where all data (in its various forms) should be kept locally.

Directory structure:

```
data/
├── cohorts/
├── interim/
├── processed/
└── raw/
```

Where:
1. `cohorts` holds the original cohorts generated by `yaib-cohorts` and the extended cohorts
2. `interim` holds any intermediate data, such as combined data or data with imputed values
3. `processed` holds the data with already extracted features
4. `raw` holds the raw eICU data in form of tables as `.csv files`
